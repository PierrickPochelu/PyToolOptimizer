"# PyToolOptimizer" 

This project is a tool to help searchers in Optimization to code exciting new optimizer ! 

You can use any part or all this project to help you to implement new function or new optimizer. It's especially handsome in Deep Learning area because it abstracts complexity of Deep Learning framework.

<h1>Why this framework is usefull ?</h1>
The use of this framework is particularly recommended in the field of Deep Learning where update weight directly in TF is difficult to implement. This framework proposes to abstract this complexity with the forward and gradient descent are computed in GPU and the optimization is partially written in Python.
